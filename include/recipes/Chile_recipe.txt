 Here is a recipe for a traditional Chilean Porotos Granados, a vegetarian stew that uses some of the ingredients you provided:

Ingredients:

- 1 pound dried porotos beans (kidney beans), soaked overnight (or at least 6 hours) and drained
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 pound small potatoes, halved
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup diced fresh or canned pineapple (optional)
- 1/4 cup chopped pitted black olives
- 1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese (or substitute vegan cheese)
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the salsa:

- 1/2 pint cherry tomatoes, quartered
- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon lime juice
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Instructions:

1. In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saut√© until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, and coriander, and cook for another minute.

2. Add the drained beans, potatoes, and vegetable broth to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 30-45 minutes, or until the beans and potatoes are tender. (You may need to add more broth or water if the stew is getting too dry.)

3. Meanwhile, make the salsa by mixing together the tomatoes, cilantro, extra virgin olive oil, lime juice, and salt in a small bowl.

4. Once the beans and potatoes are tender, add the pineapple (if using) and olives to the pot. Cook for an additional 5-10 minutes to warm through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. Ladle the stew into bowls and top with shredded cheese. Serve with the salsa on the side. You can also sprinkle some fresh chopped cilantro on top for added flavor and decoration.

If you'd like to include onions in this recipe, you can dice them and add them to the saucepan after sweating the garlic. You can also use fresh or canned pineapple depending on your preference and what's available to you. If you'd like to keep this recipe vegan, simply omit the cheese or
