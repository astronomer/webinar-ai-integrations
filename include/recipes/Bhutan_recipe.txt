 Here is a recipe forEJ Spectacle from Bhutan, a delicious potato and onion stew perfect for a cold evening:

Ingredients:

- 2 cups thinly sliced potatoes (about 1½ pounds)
- 1 cup thinly sliced onions
- 2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- ½ teaspoon asafoetida (hing) powder 
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 cups vegetable broth (or water)
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice

Instructions:

1. In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes, onions, olive oil, cumin seeds, asafoetida powder, paprika, turmeric powder, salt and black pepper. Stir well to coat the vegetables in the oil and spices.

2. Pour in the vegetable broth, bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.

3. Stir in the cilantro and lemon juice, and serve hot. 

If you prefer a more indulgent dish you can replace the olive oil with butter and swap the cilantro with parsley and chives, Gruyere cheese would also make a good addition to this dish, you can add ½ cup grated Gruyere cheese to the saucepan after 10 minutes of simmering, allowing it to melt into the stew. 

For a vegan alternative, you can substitute the butter with coconut oil and the Gruyere with a vegan cheese alternative or omit the cheese altogether.
