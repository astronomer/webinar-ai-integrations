 Here is a recipe for Cameroonian Rigonneau (a delicious vegetarian dish from Cameroon that uses potatoes, onions, and pineapple):

Ingredients:

2 pound potatoes, peeled and diced
1/2 cup olive oil
1 large onion, diced
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable broth
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks in juice
1 cup grated Gruyere or Swiss cheese

Instructions:

1. In a large saucepan, cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Drain and set aside.

2. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the baking powder, cumin, ginger, garlic powder, chili powder, oregano, basil, and thyme. Cook for an additional minute to release the flavors.

3. Add the potatoes to the skillet and stir to coat in the onion and spice mixture. Add the salt and vegetable broth, stirring gently to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated.

4. Drain the pineapple chunks, reserving the juice. Stir the pineapple chunks into the potato mixture. Add the grated cheese, stirring until melted and combined. If the mixture is too dry, add a small amount of the reserved pineapple juice.

5. Serve the Rigonneau hot, with additional pineapple chunks and cheese on top.
