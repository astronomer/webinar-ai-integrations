 Here is a recipe for a potato and olive casserole (Tortet Haugesund) from Norway that uses gruyere, potatoes, and onions. This recipe is traditionally from Haugesund, a city in western Norway. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a recipe that includes pineapple, but I can suggest a delicious Norwegian dessert option that uses apples, a fruit that is widely available in Norway and has a rich history in their cuisine. 

For a vegetarian version of this recipe, you can substitute the milk with a non-dairy alternative and use a vegetarian substitute for the rennet. Here is the recipe:

For the Apple Cake:
- 2 cups (260 g) all-purpose flour

Instructions: 

Tortet:
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) round baking dish.

2. Peel and slice the potatoes thinly. Place them in a large pot of lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender but still hold their shape. Drain and set aside.

3. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the olives and onion and cook until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.

4. In a small saucepan, heat the milk, salt, pepper, and nutmeg over
