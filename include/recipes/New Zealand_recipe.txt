 Here is a recipe for a Potato and Gruyere Tart from New Zealand:

### Gratin Dauphinois with Pineapple Salad 

New Zealand is a young country with a varied food culture that encompasses British, European, Pacific Rim, and Indigenous influences. This dish is a twist on a traditional French recipe that fuses local ingredients from the Canterbury region of New Zealand. 

**Ingredients:**

* 1 lb Potatoes 
* 1/2 cup Gruyere Cheese 
* 1/2 cup Cream 
* 1/2 cup Milk 
* 2 tbsp Butter
* 2 tbsp Flour
* 1/2 tsp Nutmeg
 * Salt and Pepper to taste
* For the Salad 
* 1 small Pineapple 
* 1/2 cup Olives 
* 1/2 red Onion 
* 2 tbsp Lime juice 
* 1 tbsp Olive oil 

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F and grease a medium-sized baking dish.

2. Peel and thinly slice the potatoes. Place them in a large bowl and cover with cold water to prevent them from turning brown.

3. In a small saucepan, heat the milk, cream, and butter over medium heat until the butter is melted. Stir in the flour and nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until the mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat and set aside.

4. Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with a paper towel. Layer half of the potatoes in the prepared baking dish, followed by half of the cheese. Repeat with the remaining potatoes and cheese.

5. Pour the cream mixture over the potatoes and cheese. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the top is golden brown. Cover with aluminum foil if the top is browning too quickly and the potatoes aren't cooked yet. 

6. While the gratin is baking, prepare the salad. Chop the pineapple, olives, and red onion into small pieces and mix in a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste. 

7. When the gratin is finished baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes before serving. Serve with the salad on the side, and enjoy!
