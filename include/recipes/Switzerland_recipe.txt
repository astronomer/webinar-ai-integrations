 Here is a recipe for a delicious vegetarian potato gratin with a Swiss twist that uses some of the ingredients you listed:

Ingredients:

- Potatoes: You will need about 1.5kg of waxy potatoes such as Yukon Gold or similar varieties.
- Gruyere cheese: This is a traditional Swiss cheese for this recipe, but you can also use other cheeses such as Emmental or Swiss cheese. You will need about 350g / 12oz of cheese.
- Onion: You will need half a medium-sized onion.
- Pineapple: Although this is an unusual ingredient in a potato gratin, you can add a small can of crushed pineapple (160g / 5.6oz) for a sweet and savory twist. 
- Olives: You can add 100g of your favorite olives, such as kalamata or green olives.
- Breadcrumbs: For the topping, you will need about 50g of breadcrumbs. 
- Vegan alternatives: For a vegan version, you can use vegan cheese alternatives such as cashew cheese or a vegan gruyere style cheese, and swap the milk and butter with plant-based alternatives. 

Recipe:

1. Preheat your oven to 180C / 350F (fan assisted), or 200C / 400F (conventional).

4. In a frying pan, cook the onion and olives (if using) in butter or oil over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Add the crushed pineapple (if using) and cook for an additional minute. 

5. In a casserole or baking dish, layer half of the potatoes at the bottom of your dish. Follow with half of the onion, olive and pineapple mixture, and half of your cheese. Repeat these layers once more.

6. In a small bowl, combine 50g of breadcrumbs with 20g of melted butter or plant-based butter alternative, and mix well. If you want a crunchy topping, add another 20g of breadcrumbs. 

7. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture over the top of your potato gratin and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the top is
